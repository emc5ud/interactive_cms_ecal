Interactive visualization of the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The detector is broken up in into two sections: the ECAL endcaps (EE) and ECAL barrel (EB). These sections can be toggled on or off with a button. The detector is made up of rings differing in (eta)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorapidity], a measurement of angle away from the central beam line. Information about particle travel time is given based on the position of the ring.
